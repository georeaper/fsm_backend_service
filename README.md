## 🔐 1. **Authentication & Authorization**

* ✅ **JWT (or session-based auth)**: Ensure token validation and refresh logic.
* 🔐 **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Define user roles (e.g., Admin, Technician) and enforce access rules on sensitive routes.

---

## 📦 2. **Business Logic & Services Layer**

* ✨ Abstract logic away from the route handlers into services.
* Use a **clean architecture** approach: routes → controllers → services → repositories.
* Promote testability and separation of concerns.

---

## 📂 3. **Database Management**

* 🧠 Use **Exposed** or **JDBC** effectively.
* ✅ Write upsert/CRUD logic safely (you already mentioned grouping them in classes).
* ⚠️ Handle migration with tools like **Flyway** or **Liquibase**.
* Index critical fields to optimize performance.
* 💾 Optional: add **caching** (e.g., Redis) for read-heavy endpoints.

---

## 🔁 4. **Data Sync & Conflict Resolution**

* If your mobile/desktop apps work offline:

  * Timestamped syncing (you’re already doing this ✅).
  * Conflict resolution strategies: **last write wins**, or **manual review**.
  * Make sync APIs robust and traceable (logging, request tracing).

---

## 🔄 5. **Error Handling & Logging**

* Standardize your API responses (e.g., using a common `ApiResponse` wrapper).
* Log important events and errors (with **SLF4J** + **Logback**).
* Use exception middleware in Ktor to return proper HTTP codes.

---

## 📈 6. **Monitoring & Health Checks**

* Expose a `/health` route for server monitoring.
* Integrate **Prometheus** + **Grafana** for system metrics if needed.
* Use Ktor plugins or interceptors for logging request durations.

---

## 🛡 7. **Security**

* Sanitize inputs to avoid SQL injection (Exposed helps with that).
* Enable HTTPS in production.
* Rate limiting, IP blocking, or bot protection on auth endpoints.
* Use environment variables for secrets/configs (via HOCON or `.env`).

---

## 🧪 8. **Testing**

* Unit tests for services and logic.
* Integration tests for key APIs (especially sync and login).
* Postman or Ktor client-based automated tests.

---

## 📄 9. **API Documentation**

* Use **OpenAPI / Swagger** for self-documenting APIs.

  * Ktor has integrations for Swagger via `ktor-swagger`.

---

## 🧩 10. **Frontend Integration (React & KMP)**

* CORS configuration in Ktor.
* API versioning (`/api/v1/...`).
* Upload/download endpoints for images or documents.
* Format and paginate responses to make life easier on the frontend.

---

## 🚀 Bonus Areas

* **WebSockets** (for real-time updates like Work Order status changes).
* **Background jobs / Queues** (Ktor has coroutine support, or use something like RabbitMQ).
* **Email notifications / Push notifications**.
